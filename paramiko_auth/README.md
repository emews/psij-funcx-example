# Paramiko Authentication and Tunneling Examples

`notebook.ipynb` contains the following examples:

1. Key based authentication using paramiko
2. Password based authentication (Theta)
3. Password + 2FA (Duo) based authentication (Midway2)
4. Database query over an SSH Tunnel.

Note that all these examples are hard coded to my (Nick C.)
ssh config. Update as necessary.
